# Always On Top

This script adds hotkeys to keep windows always on top(AOT), even when not active, as well as a toggle to see through and click through AOT windows. This is very useful for working with multiple windows, especially if you're tight on monitor space.

Pressing ctrl+space will toggle whether the currently selected window is always on top. Capslock will toggle whether all AOT windows are transparent and click-through-able.

AOT windows will behave like normal windows among each other, as windows are either always on top or not.

You only need the .exe file unless you want to customize the hotkeys. Simply run the script and the hotkeys will be active.

## Instructions

You should make this script run on startup. See [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/208224/how-to-add-programs-files-and-folders-to-system-startu    p-in-windows-8.1/)

## Customization

If you want to change the hotkey triggers, you'll have to install AutoHotkey and modify the .ahk file.

## OS Compatability

At the moment, this script will only work on Windows, as other OSs don't support AutoHotKey. If you make this script work on any other OS, please submit a pull request so we can add it to this repo.
