# Wifi

This script allows you to view the passwords stored on your computer by running commands in the windows command line.

Simply downloading wifi.exe and double clicking it will automatically run the commands. Running as administrator is advised because many wifi passwords will not be seen otherwise. After the program is done running, check the folder for "SavedPasswords.exe" and the passwords should be there along with the wifi name.

The .py file is the python file in case you want to customize any of the code. 

## Windows only

Because this runs commands from the windows command line, this is currently only compatible with windows devices.
