# Google Transliterate 

This script adds hotkeys to let you view or copy the transliteration(pronunciation) or translation of text using Google Translate. It works on any text and language that Google Translate can detect. This script also uses Windows' built in OCR support to recognize text in images.


# Hotkeys
Alt + T: Show transliteration

Shift + Alt + T: Show and copy transliteration

Alt + R: Show Translation

Shift + Alt + R: Show and copy translation

Shift + Alt + S: Display settings menu

## Instructions

You will only need the .exe file. You can download the it file by clicking on GoogleTranslit.exe then clicking download. Simply double click the .exe file to run the script. 

You should make this script run on startup. See [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/208224/how-to-add-programs-files-and-folders-to-system-startup-in-windows-8.1/)

## Customization

The settings menu can be shown by pressing Shift + Alt + R. This will let you customize all the hotkeys, along with the language used for OCR. Because the script uses Windows' built in OCR, you will only be able to select languages from language packs you have installed. [Here is how you can install language packs (make sure to include the Optical Character Recognition language feature).](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14236/windows-language-packs)

## OS Compatability 

At the moment, this script will only work on Windows, as other OSs don't support AutoHotKey. If you make this script work on any other OS, please submit a pull request so we can add it to this repo.
