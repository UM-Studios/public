# Google Transliterate

This script adds hotkeys to let you view or copy the transliteration(pronounciation) of highlighted text using Google Translate. It works on any text and language that Google Translate can detect.

Pressing alt+t will show the transliteration as a tooltip. Pressing alt+c will do the same, but the transliteration will also be copied to your clipboard.

You only need the .exe file unless you want to customize the hotkeys. Simply run the script and the hotkeys will be active.

## Customization

If you want to change the hotkey triggers, you'll have to install AutoHotkey and modify the .ahk file.

## Run on startup

## Windows only

At the moment, this script will only work on Windows, as other OSs don't support AutoHotKey.
