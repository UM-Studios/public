# Google Transliterate

This script adds hotkeys to let you view or copy the transliteration(pronounciation) of highlighted text using Google Translate. It works on any text and language that Google Translate can detect.

Pressing alt+t will show the transliteration as a tooltip. Pressing alt+c will do the same, but the transliteration will also be copied to your clipboard.

You only need the .exe file unless you want to customize the hotkeys. Simply run the script and the hotkeys will be active.

## Instructions

You can download the .exe file by clicking on it then clicking download. Simply double click the .exe file to run the script. 

You should make this script run on startup. See [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/208224/how-to-add-programs-files-and-folders-to-system-startu    p-in-windows-8.1/)

## Customization

If you want to change the hotkey triggers, you'll have to install AutoHotkey and modify the .ahk file.

## OS Compatability 

At the moment, this script will only work on Windows, as other OSs don't support AutoHotKey. If you make this script work on any other OS, please submit a pull request so we can add it to this repo.
