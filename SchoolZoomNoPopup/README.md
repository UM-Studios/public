# Attend Your School's Zoom Meetings

This is a script to automatically join you into each of your period's zoom links at the correct time. At the moment, this is a MacOS only script.

## Instructions

1. If you do not have git, install it. In terminal, type `git --version`, and if it prompts you to install it, follow through.
2. Clone this repository. You will need a github account as well. If you don't know how to do that, open up terminal, and type
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/UM-Studios/public.git
cd public/SchoolZoomNoPopup
```
3. In terminal, type `./install.sh` and do what the script tells you to do. That's all!

## Note

If you move this directory around, you will have to redo the `install.sh`.
