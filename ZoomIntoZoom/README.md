# Joining Zoom Meetings By Link!
This is a script that lets you quickly join zoom meetings without having to deal with the hassle of opening them in your web browser.

## Use
Just type join.sh from anywhere in terminal and a popup box will appear asking you to enter your zoom link. Just paste it there and zoom will automatically launch!

## Installation
You can download this folder either by cloning it, or pasting the url [here](https://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/) and clicking download to download it as a zip file.

These scripts require that you have Node and Cocoa dialog installed (look up how to do this online). In order for you to be able to access join.sh from anywhere, you will have to move it into your bin. You should also move zmlink.js wherever you like. Make sure to update the path to zmlink.sh inside of join.sh. You should be good to go!
